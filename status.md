Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I am half way done through the videos. In the game, I have build the background, the paddles for pong, the ball, and the title. There's also functions like the ball moves randomly and resets in the middle. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I haven't finished up the game, the ball doesn't bounce on the paddles just yet, and I am only half way done throughout the videos. 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

Sometimes when the guy in the video explains or do things it's unclear, he doesn't really show us the download file on video 4, but the previous video that needed to downloaded a file he showed us where. I had to do research, and eventually went to the comments section to see what and where the file was.
